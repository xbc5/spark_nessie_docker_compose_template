An easy-mode data stack.

This is a WIP and it's only really useful for me. However, if it works for you, feel free.

It will never be a complete solution--download, and edit it for your own purposes.

That said, TODO:
1. [ ] Get a Hello World Spark script working using Nessie.
2. [ ] Write a K8 config.
3. [ ] Use Nickel: Generate both the docker-compose and K8 configs.
